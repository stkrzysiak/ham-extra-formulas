# ham-extra-formulas
LaTeX representation for formulas I encountered while studying for the amateur radio extra exam

## How 
The original work started and temporarily still maintained on [LaTeXBase](https://latexbase.com/d/7c556e92-2013-4dcc-b051-a981e99326af)

## Why 
While studying for the exam it became clear that I needed a formula crib sheet. I looked for existing resources, didn't find and and created this one. Ideally, people will encounter this in their studies and contribute as they go along. 

## Todos 
 - Add all formulas, this is not a comprehensive list, started half way through studying
 - Orgainize formulas
 - Provide reference to relevant book sections and additional resources
